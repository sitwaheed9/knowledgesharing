Abstract
Face recognition from image or video is a popular topic in
biometrics research. Many public places usually have
surveillance cameras for video capture and these cameras have
their significant value for security purpose. It is widely
acknowledged that the face recognition have played an important
role in surveillance system as it doesn’t need the object’s
cooperation. The actual advantages of face based identification
over other biometrics are uniqueness and acceptance. As human
face is a dynamic object having high degree of variability in its
appearance, that makes face detection a difficult problem in
computer vision. In this field, accuracy and speed of
identification is a main issue.
The goal of this paper is to evaluate various face detection and
recognition methods, provide complete solution for image based
face detection and recognition with higher accuracy, better
response rate as an initial step for video surveillance. Solution is
proposed based on performed tests on various face rich databases
in terms of subjects, pose, emotions, race and light.
Keywords: Face Detection, Face Recognition, Biometrics, Face
Identification.
